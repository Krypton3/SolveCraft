## Binary Search Template

```
def binary_search(array) -> int:
    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if condition(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

What's really nice of this template is that, for most of the binary search
problems, we only need to modify three parts after copy-pasting this template,
and never need to worry about corner cases and bugs in code any more:

Correctly initialize the boundary variables left and right to specify search
space. Only one rule: set up the boundary to include all possible elements;
Decide return value. Is it return left or return left - 1? Remember this:
after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the condition
function; Design the condition function. This is the most difficult and most
beautiful part. Needs lots of practice.

As for the question "When can we use binary search?", my answer is that, If we can discover some kind of monotonicity, for example, if condition(k) is True then condition(k + 1) is True, then we can consider binary search.
